Below are examples of converting user utterances into Mtop semantic parses:

Example 1:
User: i want you to record a video message for amy since she is not available now
Parse: [IN:SEND_MESSAGE [SL:TYPE_CONTENT video ] [SL:RECIPIENT amy ] ]

Example 2:
User: i want you to record a video message for Haven since she is not available now
Parse: [IN:SEND_MESSAGE [SL:TYPE_CONTENT video ] [SL:RECIPIENT Haven ] ]

Example 3:
User: i want you to record a video message for Heather Trumbo since she is not available now
Parse: [IN:SEND_MESSAGE [SL:TYPE_CONTENT video ] [SL:RECIPIENT Heather Trumbo ] ]

Now I have a new user utterance.
User: i want you to start recording a video message for Amelia
