Below are examples of converting user utterances into Mtop semantic parses:

Example 1:
User: i want you to record a video message for amy since she is not available now
Parse: [IN:SEND_MESSAGE [SL:TYPE_CONTENT video ] [SL:RECIPIENT amy ] ]

Example 2:
User: i want you to record a video message for my grandma jess
Parse: [IN:SEND_MESSAGE [SL:TYPE_CONTENT video ] [SL:RECIPIENT [IN:GET_CONTACT [SL:CONTACT_RELATED my ] [SL:TYPE_RELATION grandma ] [SL:CONTACT jess ] ] ] ]

Example 3:
User: video messaging please record a video for Kelsey with directions
Parse: [IN:SEND_MESSAGE [SL:TYPE_CONTENT video ] [SL:RECIPIENT Kelsey ] ]

Now I have a new user utterance.
User: i want you to start recording a video message for Amelia
